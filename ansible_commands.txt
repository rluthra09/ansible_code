Bring up all 3 ansible instances-1 master 2 nodes
-ifconfig to check all have 3 d/f IP's

--Check whether ping is working from master to client machines

To do dns mapping locally, instead of using IP we can mention hostname in front of IP so that it will be easy to remember
vi /etc/hosts
192.168.56.102 u64-ansible-node1
192.168.56.103 u64-ansible-node2



--To Enable passwordless connection between master and node1--
login to master
sudo su to switch to root user /root
ssh-keygen --to generate keys
copy it to your client node using below command

ssh-copy-id vagrant@u64-ansible-node1

--To Enable passwordless connection between master and node2, just to keep two different user, node1- vagrant and node2-ansible_user
adduser ansible_user  
pwd-ansible_user

From master, root user execute below command
ssh-copy-id ansible_user@u64-ansible-node2
ansible_user

--To install ansible only on master node
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common -y
sudo apt-add-repository --yesansible all -a "uptime" -u root 
ansible all -a "df -h" -u root

ansible all -m user -a "name=john password=john" -b   -- it will fail for 2 node because ansible_user is not part of sudoers, use below command to add list of sudoers
  --b means to execute command via sudoers
usermod -G sudo ansible_user
ansible all -m user -a "name=john password=john" -b  --now it will pass for 2nd node as well

Playbook:yaml format
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: create a file
      file:
        path: /tmp/myfile
        state: touch


ansible-playbook test-playbook.yaml   -- to run yaml file
ansible-playbook test-playbook.yaml --limit dev,test

 --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible -y

ansible --version

--To make node accessible via ansible ping, we need to make below entry
vi /etc/ansible/hosts
u64-ansible-node1 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant
#u64-ansible-node2 ansible_ssh_user=ansible_user
192.168.56.103 ansible_ssh_user=ansible_user

ansible -m ping all
ansible -m ping ansible-node1   --m stands for module, to be executed on master
ansible -a hostname all
ansible -a date all  --a means attributes, command to be executed on client and return the output to master
ansible -a "mkdir ~/test" all   -- to execute the same command across servers, it will be executed in parallel

--All the -m or playbook commands are idempotence but -a commands are not idempotence, -a command wil throw error if we try to create directory again.

--If passwordless connection is not working ansible will fail, above command


Module command
ansible -m setup all
ansible -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*" all
ansible all -m setup -a "filter=*ipv4*
